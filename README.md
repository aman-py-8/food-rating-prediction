# Food Rating Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict food ratings based on various features of the food items and user reviews. It uses machine learning techniques to preprocess data, train a model, and evaluate its performance. The project is built in Python and uses popular libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, and matplotlib.

## Description

This project uses machine learning to predict food ratings based on a dataset of food items and user reviews. The workflow includes:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and outlier detection.
2. **Model Training**: Using regression models (or other suitable algorithms) to train the prediction model.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and visualizing results.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the dataset using visualization tools to understand patterns and relationships.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repository:

Bash
```
git clone https://github.com/aman-py-8/food-rating-prediction.git
cd food-rating-prediction
```
## Set up the Environment
### 1 Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```
python -m venv venv
```
### 2 Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```
On macOS/Linux:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
### 3 Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Dataset
Make sure to place your dataset (e.g., train.csv) in the data/ folder. If you're using a custom dataset, update the file paths in the scripts accordingly.
## How to Run
### 1. Data Preprocessing
To preprocess the data (handling missing values, outliers, etc.), run the preprocess.py script:

```
python src/preprocess.py
```
This will load the training data, preprocess it, and save the cleaned data for training.

### 2. Model Training
To train the model, run the train_model.py script:

```
python src/train_model.py
```
This script will:

- Load the preprocessed data.
- Train a machine learning model.
- Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy and precision.
- Save the trained model for later use.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
To perform EDA and visualize the data, run the eda.py script:

```
python eda.py
```
This script will display visualizations of the data, including missing value heatmaps, feature distributions, and correlations between features.
